- fix different meanings of "fitness case". what should we do about problems like ant trail that
pass an empty fitness case array but the evaluation code uses params.fitness_case_size()?
- pull params out to be a standalone object so we don't have to copy it or return it the way we do now
- clean up duplication between run_saved_model and ant_trail_problem individual_error function

- run the program with dump = true and spend time looking at the data

- then do the sme thing again
- add any missing dump features

- get indexed memory working on trivial memory problems, then use memory on ant trail

i.e.:

- give it a random sequence of integers and ask it to recall the previous value
- ask it to compute a running sum
- ask it to detect if a sum is increasing, decreasing, or neither

- add in LSH novelty search

- do trivial synthetic time series. make it gradually more complex

forex

- change data layout so that fitness_cases[register_index][operand1] can become fitness_cases[operand1][register_index]. compare time before and after
