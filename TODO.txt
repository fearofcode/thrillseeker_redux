- get basic version of ant trail problem working but with enhanced actions so that it can see
 move in any of 8 directions

- run the program with dump = true and spend time looking at the data

- then do the sme thing again
- add any missing dump features

- get indexed memory working on trivial memory problems, then use memory on ant trail

i.e.:

- give it a random sequence of integers and ask it to recall the previous value
- ask it to compute a running sum
- ask it to detect if a sum is increasing, decreasing, or neither

- add in LSH novelty search

- do trivial synthetic time series. make it gradually more complex

forex

- change data layout so that fitness_cases[register_index][operand1] can become fitness_cases[operand1][register_index]. compare time before and after
